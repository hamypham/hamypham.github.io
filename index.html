	<p>Hi! My name is Hamy. I am originally from Boston. I received my BFA in advertising photography with a minor in art history from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2005. I spent a year in 2006 as an overseas volunteer living in SE Asia and teaching English to poor rural women. I currently call Houston,TX home. I live there with my fiance and our 2 dogs. My past professional experiences include designing at an architectural firm and managing a commercial photography studio. I am very excited to participate and share in the StartUp Institute experience with you all!
